Make sure the camera type is set to avatar.\n\n-From here on calibration and selection will be done in game. Look down, you'll see the LIV icon, pull the trigger while pointing at it and it will open the menu. Select your avatar and click calibrate on the right side.\n\n-Unlike vrchat, calibration is done by standing on two green shoes marked on the floor. From here you want to t-pose exactly like the image displayed in front of you, your hand and head positioning does matter so make sure to t-pose as close as you can to exact.\n\n-You should be done! You will not be able to discord screenshare as LIV only outputs video, but it works great with fullbody!\n\nFeel free to follow Liv's own tutorial if you happen to get stuck.\n\nSee here for more information on the unity side of your beat saber transformation! https://www.vrcarena.com/assets/lWuKBt505XrETlfHEER8\n\nExamples:\nhttps://youtu.be/hSJ8W1tl9Yc\nhttps://youtu.be/5fWIyZApl4Y\nhttps://youtu.be/ngB6fimPHjY",
